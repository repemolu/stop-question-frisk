## Stop, Question and Frisk Data Cleaning
The data set used in this project comes from the NYPD website. Stop, Question, and Frisk is a type of police civilian encounter used by the NYPD. An NYPD brochure explaining civilian rights states that, "The police are allowed to approach people and ask for information when thereâ€™s a reason for doing so. An officer has the right to stop (temporarily detain) you if he or she has a reasonable suspicion that you are committing,have committed or are about to commit a crime." The practice has received much criticism and was deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2012, yet it still persists albeit on a smaller scale than it has in the past.

My goal for cleaning this data set was to make the table more reader friendly for those who don't work in law enforcement, and to retain the metrics that would be useful for anyone interested in making data visualizations with this data.
